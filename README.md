Certainly! I'll create a README.md file for your GitHub repository that includes the steps to set up the Lambda function, configure S3 permissions, and deploy the project. Here's the content for your README.md:

# S3 Thumbnail Generator Lambda Function

This project contains an AWS Lambda function that automatically generates thumbnails for images uploaded to an S3 bucket.

## Project Overview

When an image is uploaded to the source S3 bucket, this Lambda function is triggered. It downloads the image, creates a thumbnail, and then uploads the thumbnail to a destination S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI configured on your local machine
- Python 3.8 or later
- Boto3 library
- Pillow (PIL) library

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Create two S3 buckets in the us-west-1 region:
   - Source bucket: `1234-image`
   - Destination bucket: `1234-thumnailimage`

3. Create an IAM role for your Lambda function with the following permissions:
   - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
   - S3 read access to the source bucket
   - S3 write access to the destination bucket

   Use the following policy document:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::1234-image/*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:PutObject"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::1234-thumnailimage/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. Create a Lambda function:
   - Runtime: Python 3.8
   - Handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler
   - Role: Use the IAM role created in step 3

5. Copy the contents of `lambda_function.py` into your Lambda function code.

6. Configure the S3 trigger for your Lambda function:
   - Select the source bucket (1234-image)
   - Event type: All object create events

7. Deploy your Lambda function.

## Testing

To test the function:
1. Upload an image to the source S3 bucket (1234-image).
2. Check the destination S3 bucket (1234-thumnailimage) for the generated thumbnail.
3. Verify the Lambda function logs in CloudWatch.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check the Lambda function's execution role permissions.
- Verify that both S3 buckets exist and are in the correct region.
- Review CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages.
